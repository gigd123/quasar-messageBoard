### How to run this project?
This project is written for a practice that can help learning how to use quarsar, so it didn't have a real database, instead we have a db.json in root directory. First you should install json-server(npm i json-server -g), then type "json-server /directory-name/db.json" in your terminal, it will start up a virtual server, then run this project with "quasar dev", so you can start use test this small project.

This is the first time I used quasar develop a project, if you find any thing should correct in this project, please let me know, hope you'll like it.
